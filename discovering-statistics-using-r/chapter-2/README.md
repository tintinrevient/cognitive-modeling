## Core
**observed<sub>i</sub> = (model) + error<sub>i</sub>**

**deviation = &Sigma;(observed - model)<sup>2</sup>**

## Model

**linear model** vs **non-linear model**:

**sample**: the data collected from a small subset of the **population**, which is used to infer things about the population as a whole.

measures of how well the model fits:
- [ ] **mean**
- [ ] **deviance**
- [x] **sum of squared error**
- [x] **variance**: the average error between the mean and the observations = a measure of how well the model **fits** the actual data.
	* **degree of freedom**
- [x] **standard deviation**

**the standard deviation is a measure of how well the mean represents the data.**
* left: the mean is a good fit to the data
* right: the mean is NOT a good fit to the data

**the standard deviation tells the shape of the distribution of scores**

**sampling variation**: samples will vary because they contain different members of the population.

**sampling distribution**: the frequency distribution of **sample means** from the same population.
* when samples > 30, sampling distribution = **normal distribution**
* when samples < 30, sampling distribution = **t-distribution**

**standard error of the mean**: the standard deviation of **sample means** = a measure of how well a sample is representative of the population.
